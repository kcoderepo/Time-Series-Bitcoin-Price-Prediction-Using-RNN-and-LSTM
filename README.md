# Time-Series-Bitcoin-Price-Prediction-Using-RNN-and-LSTM

The objective of this project is to predict the price change of bitcoin in USD over a series of time. 
Building this model helps in predicting the best time to invest by answering the question of when and how much to invest as bitcoin prices change every day on a
much greater scale than local currencies. This task is achived through the implementation of Adam optimized Recurrent Neural Networks(RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM).

Dataset:

Data is collected from bitcoin.com. It consits of 37 different excel files of bitcoin data. All the files are combined into one csv file containing bitcoin price for 
around 2667 days and 37 columns. Each row is a day and columns are features of bitcoin data.
